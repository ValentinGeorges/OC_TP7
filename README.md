I created a fully working social network for a company, if you want to try it out, here's how :

Once the repository is cloned, open two terminals.

In the first one, naviguate to /frontend/groupomania, then type "npm run serve", then click on the given link

In the second one, naviguate to /backend, then type "nodemon start".

There you go, you can now freely use the website.

This website has been made using VueJs 2.0, NodeJS and MySQL.
